# PayFlow

This project was created using Flutter, throughout a week, during a study session called Next Level Week (NLW).

The app was created with the intention to be a tool that helps people to manage their payments. It was designed to work with a brazilian form of payment, called 'Boleto', simillar to a Bank SlipÂ´.



Good to know:
This app uses Firebase as its main data storage, however the configuration file (google-services.json) will not be available in this git repository.
